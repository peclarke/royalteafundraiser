# Royal Tea Fundraiser

Built for the Garden, a christian-run communnity for university students to belong. This fundraiser aims to raise funds for two friends from our community to go on a missionary internship overseas.
I developed similar software to this for a different fundraiser which can also be found in my repository list at: https://github.com/peclarke/fundraiser

## Reason why this was redeveloped
1. Each fundraiser has it's own particular theme. This one was English / Tea themed, which resulted in the idea of filling teacups to complete milestones.
2. This software uses firebase realtime database as a truce source of information. This was simpler and overall, a much more robust solution in comparison to creating your own server from scratch.

## Features
- Donation/Milestone Tracking
- Milestones per donation
- Admin panel (mobile optimised)
- Change the donation visualiser screen from the admin panel
- Modular drop in of new screens that can be added (i.e. competition / wheel screen)
- Rudimentary authentication for admin panel

## Planned
- A templated teacup for new milestones
- Editing milestones properly from the admin panel
